libmarad - a board game implementation

gemini://thrig.me/game/marad.gmi

This implementation does not generate the moves count for each turn
pair; the caller will need to manage that as appropriate.


INSTALLATION

Build and install along the lines of:

    unset CFLAGS
    export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.16
    export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.71
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure [--prefix=...] && make && make install

Highly recommended is the --enable-the-rpath flag (or on macOS
--enable-macos-rpath) to avoid the need for LD_LIBRARY_PATH tomfoolery:

    ./configure --enable-the-rpath \
      --prefix=$HOME/usr/`uname``uname -r`-`uname -m`
    make && make install
